# Session 1 - Introduction Basic Syntax, Data Type, and Variable

## Python
Python is one of high-level programming language that popular nowadays. Most of Data Scientist use Python as their tools.
Here is some interesting feature form Python:
1. Python being the 7th most popular programming language nowadays.
2. Python is one of intrepreted languange that practice for being conducted.
3. Python can be accesses for FREE.
4. Python is simple on practicing.

Data type in Python:
1. Integers : round numbers
2. Floating-point numbers : decimal number
3. String : character
4. Boolean : True/False value

## Variable
in Python, variable not willing to declare before, meaning only mentioning the value then it can be used. Variable assignment used (=) operator. Otherwise, variable in Python can be updated. In naming the varible, it can not be initiating by numbers.
Methods on naming variable:
1. Camel case; ex: nindyaEkaApsari06
2. Pascal case; ex: NindyaEkaApsari06
3. Snake case; ex: nindya_eka_apsari_06
You can understand the difference in each methods by seeing those examples.

## Operators and Expressions
Operators is special symbol that show the must run computation. The actionable value called operand. Sequense of operand and operator, like a + b - 5, called expression. Arithmetic operators in Python, such as addition (+), subtraction, (-), multiplication (*), division (/).

## Python List
List defined in Python by adding sequence object that separated by coma in elbow brackets ([]).
Characteristic of List:
1. List are ordered.
2. List can contain any arbitrary objects.
3. List elements can be accessed by index.
4. List can be nested to arbitrary depth.
5. List are mutable.
6. List are dynamic.

## Python Tuples
Tuple defined by flanking elements in brackets (()) rather than elbow brackets ([]). Tuples can not be replaced.

## Python Dictionary
Dictionaries is implementation Python of data structure or commonly known as associative array. Dictionaries consist of key-value pairs. Every key-value pairs are mapping from key to related value.
Dictionaries and lists share the following characteristics:
1. Both are mutable.
2. Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.
3. Both can be nested. A list can contain another list. A dictionary can contain another dictionary. A dictionary can also contain a list, and vice versa.
Dictionaries differ form lists primarily in how elements are accessed:
1. List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.
2. Dictionary element are accessed via keys.
